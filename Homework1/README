ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

    1.  The outside code resources students will be

your sources in your README file. 

    2. two heads: 25%, 
       one head and one tail: 50%, 
       two tails: 25%
       The probability of one head and one tail is different from the other two. 
       Why: 0.5*0.5+0.5*0.5 = 0.5
       Possible results of every toss of two coins: head+head, head+tail, tail+head, tail+tail.
       You will have 50% the first coin is head and 50% the second coin is tail, plus 50% the first coin is tail and 50% the second coin is head. And those two add up to 0.5 which is 50%.
    3. For me, roughly 10000 times.
    4. The max trials num that doesnt produces crash: 2147483647. 
       The largest value I tried where it still worked correctly: 1000000000. 
       The one where it overflowed: 2147483648.
